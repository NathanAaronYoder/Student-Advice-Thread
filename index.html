				<p>
					1. Go to Class
					<br>
					One of the most important ways to succeed in college is to attend class. It might seem like a no-brainer, but many students miss class and fall behind. Skipping class can create loads of stress and make it nearly impossible to catch up. Your professor will give you important lectures you need to succeed in the class. And even if you have the syllabus to get reading assignments and homework, things can change. When you’re in class, you’ll stay on top of all you need to do.
					<br><br>
					2. Get Notes When You Must Miss Class
					<br>
					Everyone has to miss class every now and then. But it’s definitely not good to make it a habit. For those times when you do need to miss class, make sure and get lecture notes class materials and assignments from another classmate. This way you’ll know if you’re having a quiz or a test and what materials your professor went over. Talking to a fellow student can keep you in the loop and on top of assignments. For instance, let’s say you only need to read one chapter instead of two that the syllabus says. If a friend tells you the assignment you can use the extra time more constructively.
					<br><br>
					3. Schedule Everything
					<br>
					Scheduling every activity you do helps you to be successful in college. You’ll know how much time you have to read, to study and to play. Keeping a schedule enables you to manage your time wisely. Scheduling everything from classes to study time to lunch, work and play will stop you from procrastination which can lead to anxiety. Time how many pages you read in a minute to plan reading time. If you want to up your reading comprehension, try these tips. Keeping a schedule keeps you in control and enables you to make the best use of your time so you can enjoy a more holistic experience and succeed in college. Caveat: After you make your schedule, be sure to follow it.
					<br><br>
					4. Find A Study Buddy
					<br>
					Studying with another student can be fun. Once you read the material on your own, discuss it with a study buddy to learn a new point of view. Study buddies are especially good to have when exams come around. Your study buddy might give you different perspectives on the subject you didn’t think of. And vice versa. Having a study buddy also helps you use auditory skills as you talk out the content with your buddy. Talking with a study buddy provides another means to remember the material that’s important to know when test time comes around. Check out these study tips to get you started.
					<br><br>
					5. Join A Study Group
					<br>
					Many students join study groups right before exams. Some even before them. Joining a study group helps classmates fill in gaps of knowledge you don’t understand and misconceptions about the material. Study groups make learning more enjoyable, improve your social life and prepare you for class.
					<br><br>
					6. Rewrite Your Class Notes
					<br>
					A good way to put class concepts into your long-term memory is to rewrite your notes. It’s easy to copy lecture notes and forget about them. Make an outline after class. It will help you understand the material and remember it.
					<br><br>
					7. If You Need Help, Find A Tutor
					<br>
					Many people get embarrassed about seeking out a tutor. But tutors help you succeed in college. If you’re confused about the subject, book appointment with a tutor. You’ll get one-on-one attention and the tutor can help you understand class concepts, so you do better in class.
					<br><br>
					8. Meet With Your Instructor During Office Hours
					<br>
					Every instructor or professor holds office hours. The school actually requires professors to offer office hours to students to discuss coursework and other issues like needing extra time to take tests for students with learning disabilities. There’s no one better to explain what’s important for the class than your instructor. It’s another way to have one-on-one attention. Seeing your professor during office hours helps you learn what’s essential to know for the class. It can improve your grade.
					<br><br>
					9. Get Social
					<br>
					It’s important for students to take a break from academics. Joining social activities can give you an enriching school experience that goes beyond academics. And schools offer plenty of opportunities to engage with other students outside of the classroom. Getting social also provides a great way to destress from a rigorous academic schedule.
					<br><br>
					Athletics
					<br>
					One way you can get social with other students is to get involved in athletics. Sports build endorphins which also fights stress. Find a sport that interests you. Join the football team, volleyball team or basketball team. While schools offer competitive sports, they also offer intramural sports like softball.
					<br><br>
					Sororities and Fraternities
					<br>
					Joining a sorority or fraternity offers students a great way to make new friends and build leadership schools. They hold parties, dances and abundant opportunities to build leadership skills. Fraternities and sororities not only help you succeed in college. They can prepare you for the workforce. To add, many former students remain friends with their sorority sisters or fraternity brothers for their entire lives.
					<br><br>
					Clubs
					<br>
					Schools hold clubs for everything you can think of. Get involved in school politics, join an international club, see movies on campus or try your hand at the chess club. You can even write articles for the newspaper school paper. Need some cash? Then get a job on campus. You’ll make new friends and put a little extra money in your pocket.
					<br><br>
					The Takeaway on How To Succeed In College
					<br>
					Now you know nine tips that will help you succeed in college. Remember you don’t have to do it alone. A successful college experience requires more than academics. Follow these tips to have a complete and enriching experience in college.

				<h3>5 Essential Tips for How to Choose College Classes</h3>
				<div class='authorDate'>
					<p>Posted by Laura Smith</p>
					<p>July 1, 2020</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Determining how to choose college classes can be a real challenge when you're not sure how to evaluate your options. Plus, your initial course selection may not necessarily align with the overall goals you've set for your education. That's why it's important to keep a few simple things in mind as you go about picking your classes. The following tips can help you clarify your options.
				<br><br>
				1. Challenge yourself.
				<br>
				If you want to know how to succeed in school, then this is an aspect that can't be ignored. Seek out courses that stretch your limits. Understand that learning, by its very nature, is a challenging process. So embrace that challenge.
				<br><br>
				2. Follow your interests, but stay open.
				<br>
				Your curiosity can guide you to many of the most rewarding courses. But it can also blind you to choices that may benefit you just as much, if not more. So take care not to rule out courses that seem beyond your interest. Many students find their paths to success accidentally because they have to take courses they didn't initially want to take. Stay open to the possibility of pleasant surprises by making room for a few subjects outside the pull of your curiosity. You might just discover new strengths you never knew you had.
				<br><br>
				3. Don't wait to pursue your strongest interests.
				<br>
				The sooner you get started in the subjects that interest you most, the better. It gives you a chance to really determine whether or not you feel they are something you can stick with and grow from. (Some students find out that their interests pointed them in the wrong direction.) It's always better to change your focus of study early on instead of far into your college experience.
				<br><br>
				4. Seek out classes that help you build marketable skills.
				<br>
				Knowledge and theory are important. But once you graduate, you'll need to demonstrate that you can actually do stuff that employers will pay for. So it's a good idea to pay attention to the skills that are in high demand and mix some of them into your education.
				<br><br>
				5. Pursue different classes in completely different subjects.
				<br>
				Taking widely divergent courses allows you to acquire different types of knowledge and skills that you can connect and use together in new ways. This approach often leads to the development of innovative thinking, which is a highly prized skill in today's economy. And many employers love to hire people who can provide extra value outside of their main skill set.

				<h3>4 Proven Tips on Setting Smart Goals for Students</h3>
				<div class='authorDate'>
					<p>Posted by Rory Spencer</p>
					<p>June 17, 2020</p>
				</div>
				<p>
				Wondering what the best approach is to setting smart goals? For students in college or trade school, it's an important place to start. A surprising number of students haven't thought much about it. They enter school without having a clear idea of what succeeding in college means for them personally. And they forget to map out all of their reasons for going to school, which means they often miss out on the powerful benefits of goal setting for students. But right now you have the chance to make sure you get it right. Following some or all of the 10 tips below can make a big difference in your ability to get the most out of your education.
				<br><br>
				1. Imagine your ideal outcome.
				<br>
				Success in college begins with a sense of what's possible. So it's much easier to accomplish your goals if you can visualize what you want. It gives you a clear purpose. It provides a beacon of hope to help guide you during challenging times. And the great thing is that it doesn't have to be permanent. As you change and grow, what you imagine can change and grow with you.
				<br><br>
				2. Approach college with the right attitude.
				<br>
				One of the most important habits of a successful student is treating school as a gift of opportunity rather than as a necessary evil. The students who thrive are not content with being average or just skating by. Instead, they focus on using their time in school to maximize their individual potential as much as possible.
				<br><br>
				3. Take charge of your education.
				<br>
				The best results come from staying proactive. So don't wait to be told what to do. Seek out ways to go beyond the minimum required. Stay alert to new opportunities that will help you grow in some way. Take calculated risks. Put your future in your own hands instead of hoping that someone else will come along and lead the way for you.
				<br><br>
				4. Get the "whys" right.
				<br>
				If you want to become a successful student, then you have to go to school for the right reasons. That means valuing results that have real substance instead of fleeting or elusive outcomes like fame, prestige, or recognition. Be honest with yourself about why you want to go to school. Make sure your reasons line up with things that stick around—such as personal development, acquiring marketable skills, improving your understanding of the world, improving your ability to provide for your family, and so on.

				<h3>Exceeding in school.</h3>
				<div class='authorDate'>
					<p>Posted by Logan Grim</p>

				</div>
				<p>
				It may sound strange, but one of the best ways to appreciate the path you're on is to walk along a different one now and then. Take time to discover some of the hidden gems in your area—like fringe art galleries, quirky cafés, and less-traveled walking and hiking paths. Step beyond your usual interests and expose yourself to new kinds of art and music. Stake out your own nook in a place you haven't explored before.
				<br><br>
				Maybe you're afraid of failing. Maybe you fear criticism. Maybe the very idea of success makes you nervous because it means that you have to grow and change to reach it. All of these fears are unnecessary—and you can defeat them. So face your fears head on. Then chase them away by doing the stuff you're in school to do. Successful students sometimes call it practicing stubborn persistence. It's one of the biggest secrets in any student's success. You have to push on. You have to keep showing up. You have to do the work anyway.
				<br><br>
				One of the greatest things about college is that you get to steer your own ship. You don't need permission to pursue the things that will make you successful. Other people might have reasons to wish you weren't in your position—like jealousy—but you don't have to seek their approval. The momentum to succeed starts within you. And only you.
				<br><br>
				Good advice can be helpful. But only if you follow it by taking action. Some students binge on self-help and personal development advice so much that they eventually burn out and lose the motivation to do anything. They never bother applying any of it to their own lives. Instead, they use it as a way to daydream about success rather than actually doing anything about it. So take advice in small doses, but be skeptical of it also. Not all so-called good advice will be good for your individual situation.
				<br><br>
				Getting a bad grade isn't the end of the world. And having a few negative thoughts isn't so bad either. The truth is that an obsession with self-esteem can work against you. It can blind you from your weaknesses and give you an unjustified sense of your greatness. It's more helpful to embrace the fact that you are not perfect. Experiencing a little self-doubt can help you stay focused on more of the details and avoid mistakes. Self-doubt can also motivate you to work harder. It exists to remind you that you're learning and still have plenty of room to grow. That's a good thing.

				<h3>Focus on actually learning, not just on your grades.</h3>
				<div class='authorDate'>
					<p>Posted by Helen Sylph</p>

				</div>
				<p>
				When you prioritize gaining deep knowledge, retaining what you learn, and mastering valuable skills, the grades tend to take care of themselves. So don't obsess over trying to avoid bad grades. If you get them, simply learn from them and use the experience to improve your habits. Grades are only one measurement of your progress. They never tell the whole story. Only you know whether or not you are really learning something. Never forget that employers expect you to back up your paper degree with actual knowledge and abilities.
				<br><br>
				Success isn't some grand event that happens overnight. It's developed every day, little by little. Think of the process of achieving your goals more as evolution than revolution. It takes time. Make sure you master all of the small stuff so that it eventually adds up to something big.
				<br><br>
				Although your short-term goals should be reachable, your long-term goals should feel just out of reach. If you always feel like you've got everything in the bag, then your big goals probably aren't ambitious enough. By dreaming a little bigger, you stretch your potential, sustain your drive, and increase your chances of reaching your vision of success.
				<br><br>
				If you catch yourself saying or thinking that you're not worthy, that you're not talented enough, or that the things before you are too hard or impossible, take a few moments to really listen. Then identify these negative words as the lies they are. They aren't really a part of you. Are you going to give your goals up to them? Students who succeed know how to keep them away by choosing more constructive words to tell themselves.
				<br><br>
				In the job market after you graduate, skills will be the main currency. So by planning from the beginning to be an ace at things that employers value, you can give yourself a head start on your classmates in the race to stand out after graduation.
				<br><br>
				It seems counterintuitive, but placing too much focus on strengthening your weak areas can sometimes decrease your chances of success. Instead of spending a majority of time improving their weaknesses, many of the most successful college students dedicate the bulk of their energy to honing and maximizing what they are best at. That doesn't mean ignoring the other areas; it just means taking advantage of who you really are. We're each good at different things. By building on our strengths, we can each become great in our own ways.
